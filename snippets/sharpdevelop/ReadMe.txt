To build Binding you have to:
1) download #Develop 3.2 sources from here:
   http://www.sharpdevelop.net/OpenSource/SD/Download/
2) extract them to any directory (I use C:\!Proj\SharpDevelop\3.2)
   and define SharpDevelopSrc environment variable
3) build #Develop


Ensure that Nemerle.dll, Nemerle.Macros.dll, Nemerle.Compiler.dll are stored in GAC.
