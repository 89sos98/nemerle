        Depending on your system you may want to use either the source
        code release or prebuilt packages.

          We are trying to put <tt>nemerle</tt> into <tt>main</tt>,
          but for now you should use our repository. You will find
          all relevant information at <link>download/deb/</link>.
       </p>
	<p>
          Notice, that <tt>mono-jit</tt> is available only in
          <tt>unstable</tt>, and for <tt>i386</tt> platform.

        <p>
          The MSI packages for Windows are available in

        </p>
        <p>
          In order to run Nemerle programs you will need Microsoft .NET
          Framework Version 1.1 Redistributable Package. You can check
          if you already have it installed in Add/Remove Software in
          Control Panel. You can install it either using Windows
          Update, or download
          <a ref="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=262D25E3-F589-4842-8157-034D1E7CF3A3&amp;displaylang=en">from Microsoft</a>.

      <title>RPM packages</title>
      <body>
        <p>
          The RPM packages are available in <link>download/rpm/</link>.
          They require <tt>mono</tt> package version 0.31 or later,
          but are otherwise architecture independent.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have mono installed outside <file>/usr</file>,
          you cannot use these rpms. Use source code release then.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to compile Nemerle programs you need both
          <tt>nemerle</tt> and <tt>nemerle-libs</tt> packages.
          <tt>nemerle-libs</tt> contains just <file>Nemerle.dll</file>.
          The <file>packages.*</file> files are indexes for 
          <a ref="http://poldek.pld.org.pl/">Poldek RPM management
          helper tool</a>. If you don't use poldek you don't need them.

      <p>
        It contains compiler sources, prebuilt bootstrap compiler
        as an architecture independent .NET binary, and prebuilt
        documentation in HTML version. It can be therefore used for
        both recompilation and binary installation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unix environment is required (tested under Windows with <a

        Source code release can be found in <link>download/</link>,

        Project sources are kept in <a
        ref="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>
        repository.  You can access it with a web browser at
        <link>http://nemerle.org/cgi-bin/svn/</link>, or
        with Subversion (or other WebDAV enabled client)
        at <link>http://nemerle.org/svn/</link>. You can
        also use <link>http://nemerle.org:81/svn/</link> or
        <link>https://nemerle.org/svn/</link> to bypass HTTP proxies.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also provide daily incremental dumps of the repository
        at <link>svn-backup/</link>.

    <body>
      <p>
        If you are programming in Nemerle and you would like to
        emphasize this fact, then you can use one of our special banners
        They can be found in <link>download/banners/</link> and contain
        emblems for <tt>developer</tt>, <tt>coder</tt> and <tt>hacker</tt>.
        They can be used freely, but you should provide link to our homepage 
        with them, like:
      </p>
<code>
&lt;a href="http://nemerle.org">&lt;img src="coder.png" alt="Nemerle coder">&lt;/a>
</code>
      <p>
        Banners were created by Piotr Modrzyk. Thanks!
