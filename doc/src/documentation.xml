    songs, spells, enchantments, and invocations.

        Unfortunately the documentation generator module is not ready
        yet, so for Nemerle libraries you will have to look at
        the sources.  You can find the most recent version <a
        ref="http://nemerle.org/svn/nemerle/trunk/lib/">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also have a look at the .NET <a
        ref="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/cpref/html/cpref_start.asp">class
        library documentation</a> at MSDN.
