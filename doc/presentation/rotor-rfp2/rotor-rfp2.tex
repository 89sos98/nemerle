\subsection{Abstract}

The objective of this project is to design and implement a new 
hybrid (functional, object-oriented and imperative) programming 
language for the .NET platform. Key features of the language 
include: simplicity, a C\#-like syntax, easy to use object 
system (derived directly from the .NET), powerful code-generating 
macros, variants, pattern matching and type inference. We plan 
to make the language a full CLS consumer and producer, which 
fits the .NET as good as C\# does.

We will focus on investigating optimization opportunities 
raising as consequence of tightening the language's type system.
We will also try to investigate which way of implementing features
crucial to a functional language would yield the best performance 
on the SSCLI and the current .NET framework.

\section{Project Description}

\subsection{Background}
Building programming language on the .NET framework base, makes large
variety of libraries for performing everyday programming tasks immediately
available. On the other hand lack of libraries (and in general problems
with implementation) seem to be one of major stoppers for functional
programming languages. Designing language that will provide easy way
to access both its functional features and object oriented .NET world
would be major win.

The problem with ports of existing languages is compatibility with
non-.NET ports that makes access to .NET features harder.

Problem z istniejacymi jezykami jest taki ze istnieja, wiec ciezej je przerabiac.
