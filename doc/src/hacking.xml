  <title>Random notes for Nemerle developers</title>
  <section id="svn">
    <title>The Subversion</title>
    <body>
      <p>
        You can fetch nemerle tree using following command:
      </p>
<code>
svn co http://nemerle.org/svn/nemerle/trunk nemerle
</code>
      <p>
        This will create <tt>nemerle/</tt> directory (last parameter)
        below current working directory.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should use entire sentences when writing commit logs. Sentence
        starts with capital letter and ends with a dot. Keep this in mind,
        as ChangeLog files in releases are automatically generated from
        commit logs, and should look consistent. Don't use past forms in
        commit logs. For example write "Add foobar to function baz." not
        "Added foobar to function baz."  (this is common practice).
