    <title>The repository</title>
    <body>
      <p>
        All the project files, are stored in the subversion
        repository, at <link>http://nemerle.org/svn</link>.  You can
        access them with your web browser, or a subversion client
        (check <link>http://subversion.tigris.org</link> for further
        information).

      <title>Fetching Nemerle</title>
      <body>
        <p>
          You can fetch nemerle tree using following command:
        </p>
<code>
svn co http://nemerle.org/svn/nemerle/trunk nemerle
</code>
      <p>
        This will create <tt>nemerle/</tt> directory (last parameter)
        below current working directory.  You need no password to
        check out the repository (so-called anonymous read-only
        access), but you will need it to commit any changes you make.
      </p>

    <subsection id="logs">
      <title>Commit logs</title>
      <body>
        <p>
          You should use entire sentences when writing commit logs. A sentence
          starts with a capital letter and ends with a full stop. Keep this in mind,
          as ChangeLog files in releases are automatically generated from
          commit logs, and should look consistent. Don't use past forms in
          commit logs. For example write "Add foobar to function baz."
          instead of "Added foobar to function baz."  (which is common
          practice).

if (foo (bar ())) then
  (baz : qux ())
else blah ()

          Set expand tabs option in your editor. We don't want ASCII 0x09 
          characters in sources.

    <title>Tools</title>
    <body>
      <p>
        There are some tools, you will probably find useful while
        helping us write all the software, and documentation related
        to the project.  We try to keep this list complete, and up to
        date, but there still may be some pieces of software, that we
        forgot, as it seems natural for us to have it installed.

      <title>Required to build Nemerle Compiler</title>
      <body>
        <p>
	  You need a .NET environment, and a C# compiler.  There are
	  several environments you can find.
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><a ref="http://www.microsoft.com/net">Microsoft .NET Framework (version 1.1 or higher)</a></li>
	  <li><a ref="http://go-mono.com">Mono</a> (version 0.29 or higher)</li>
	  <li><a ref="http://www.dotgnu.org">DotGNU</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	  You should get nemerle compiler in the tarball.  If you
	  experience any problems with it, or have downloaded sources
	  from subversion repository, use the one from
	  <link>http://nemerle.org/download/ncc-boot.exe</link>.

	  These are not prerequisites to do any task, but may be very
	  helpful, and we ask you to use them, as they minimize amount
	  of mistakes.
        </p>
	<ul>
	  <li>We suggest to scan documents with
<code>
ispell -d american -h file.xml
</code>
              or use your favorite development environment to do it
	      for you.</li>
	  <li>To validate XML syntax use
<code>
xmllint --noout --xinclude file.xml
