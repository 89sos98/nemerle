      <p>
	<b>Nemerle</b> is a new programming language with the following
        planned features:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>Language with strong polymorphic typing compiled to CIL (.NET),
	    similar to OCaml</li>
	<li>Type inheritance and dynamic types introduced on demand which makes
            programming less error prone but still as easy as in scripting
	    languages</li>
	<li>Efficient integration of functional constructs with imperative
	    and object oriented code together with high level optimizations
	    that makes it possible to create efficient code with high level
	    language</li>
	<li>Easy to write syntax extensions that make programming easier
	    and facilitate the work on large projects</li>
	<li>Translation to and from TRS that gives support for integration
	    with automatic testing, program verification and profiling 
	    tools</li>
	<li>Compatibility with <b>CLI</b> (Common Language Infrastructure, part
	    of Microsoft's <b>.NET</b> framework) that gives access to a large
	    set of libraries, code written in other languages and it works on
	    different software platforms</li>
      </ul>

        At present the work on Nemerle is in early stages where we finish the
	first compiler of the core version of the language. The compiler is
	written in OCaml and will be used to bootstrap the full Nemerle
	compiler later. To compile it you need <a ref="http://www.ocaml.org/">
	OCaml 3.06</a> and to generate the documentation you need xsltproc
	and <a ref="http://www.kernel.pl/~malekith/xspp/">xspp</a>. All generated
        documentation is available from this site.

      <p>
        To meet our goals we divided our work into three parts:
      </p>
        <ul>
	<li>Core Nemerle compiler written in 
	    <a ref="http://www.ocaml.org">OCaml</a> that does not support some
	    of the features and generates C# code. It will be used to bootstrap
	    the full Nemerle compiler</li>
	<li>Nemerle compiler written in core Nemerle that will generate CIL or
	    generic CIL code and will have support for syntax extensions,
	    extended type inference, full code commenting convention and
	    documentation generation and well designed searchable and
	    extensible standard library</li>
	<li>Abstract Nemerle language generation for Nemerle compiler and back
	    translation from Abstract Nemerle to Nemerle. Translation between
	    Abstract Nemerle and Term Rewriting Systems and tools to facilitate
	    logical analysis of Nemerle code</li>
	</ul>

        At present we are finishing the core Nemerle compiler in OCaml and
	we have a description of the work we want to do in the next stages.
