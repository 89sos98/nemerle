To build and debug Binding you have to:
1) download #Develop 3.2 sources from here:
   http://www.sharpdevelop.net/OpenSource/SD/Download/
2) extract them to any directory (I use C:\!Proj\SharpDevelop\3.2)
   and define SharpDevelop30 environment variable
3) build #Develop
4) build binding

Install script compiles binding directly to %ProgramFiles%\SharpDevelop\3.0.
