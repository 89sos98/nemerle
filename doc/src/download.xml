        Depending on your system you may want to use either the source
        code release or prebuilt packages.

          The DEB packages will be available in <link>download/deb/</link>.

      <title>RPM packages</title>
      <body>
        <p>
          The RPM packages are available in <link>download/rpm/</link>.
          They require <tt>mono</tt> package version 0.29 or later,
          but are otherwise architecture independent.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have mono installed outside <file>/usr</file>,
          you cannot use these rpms. Use source code release then.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to compile Nemerle programs you need both
          <tt>nemerle</tt> and <tt>nemerle-libs</tt> packages.
          <tt>nemerle-libs</tt> contains just <file>Nemerle.dll</file>.
          The <file>packages.*</file> files are indexes for 
          <a ref="http://poldek.pld.org.pl/">Poldek RPM management
          helper tool</a>. If you don't use poldek you don't need them.

        It contains compiler sources, prebuilt bootstrap compiler
        as a architecture independent .NET binary, and prebuilt
        documentation in HTML version. It can be therefore used for
        both recompilation and binary installation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unix environment is required (tested under Windows with <a
        ref="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a> and Linux).

        Source code release can be found in <link>download/</link>,

        with Subversion (or other WebDAV enabled client)
        at <link>http://nemerle.org/svn/</link>. You can
