REQUIREMENTS

This script expects a 'lib' directory with nunit.framework.dll and nunit.core.dll.

You should also have NUnit and NAnt with Nemerle.NAnt.Tasks.dll (e.g., in bin directory) on your path.

It expects Nemerle.dll and Nemerle.Compiler.dll to be in GAC.

Sorry for not including the files in svn, but I am not allowed to keep binaries in the repository.
