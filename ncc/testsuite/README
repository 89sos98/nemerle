Test cases format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are three kinds of magical comments:

1. // E: unbound value
2. // W: pattern.*exhaustive
3. (*
BEGIN-OUTPUT
output
blah
END-OUTPUT
*)

First one marks line, we expect error in. "error" is regular expression 
that is matched against actual error in this line.

Second one is the same, but we expect a warning.

Third one states two things:
  - we should run this test case
  - we should expect given output (verbatim)

Test case that have no "// E:" markers is expected to be compiled 
successfully by both ncc and C# compiler. If it contains no BEGIN-OUTPUT
marker, then it is compiled as C# module (needs no entry point aha 
Main() function).

tests.pl script tries to run all *.n files in current directory. It links 
lib/core.n and lib/list.n.
