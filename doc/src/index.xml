        <li>powerful code-generating macros</li>
        <li>variants</li>
        <li>pattern matching</li>
        <li>static and on-demand dynamic typing</li>
        <li>type inference.</li>

          We're heading for the 0.1 release around Feb 15. IL code
          generator is now fully operational, we also can export and
          import Nemerle types in DLLs. Macros has undergone much
          redesign.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Jan 4 2004</b><br/>
          Paweł Olszta works on IL code generation using
          <tt>System.Reflection.Emit</tt> to replace our current approach
          with C# compiler in the middle.  He was also working on Nemerle
          type export/import using extended attributes.  Michal Moskal
          has implemented tail recursion elimination, some limited type
          inference and rewritten parser in Nemerle.  Kamil Skalski has
          been working on macros -- several macros are fully functional
          now (<tt>printf</tt>, <tt>for</tt>, <tt>using</tt>).  He also
          rewrite lexer in Nemerle. Compiler contains no C# sources
          any more. Dawid Duda has written few standard library modules.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Nov 26 2003</b><br/>
          Cleanups in documentation. Progress is being made in the
          compiler, particularly in CLS connectivity section (Pawel Olszta)
          and macros (Kamil Skalski).

          Jacek Śliwerski has updated <link>hacking.html</link> file to list
          build requirements. He also updated our build system by adding
          custom configure script.
