Overall organization of Nemerle Standard Library:

 + List  [module] - list operations
 + Queue [class]  - FIFO queues with amortized complexity O(n) where n
                    is number of elements that pass through the queue
 + Stack [class]  - LIFO queues (stack) with amortized complexity O(n) 
                    where n is number of elements that pass through
                    the queue
