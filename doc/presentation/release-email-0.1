Nemerle
~~~~~~~

We are pleased to announce 0.1 release of Nemerle -- a new hybrid
(functional, object-oriented and imperative) programming language for
the .NET platform.

Key features of the language include:

    * simplicity,
    * C#-like syntax,
    * easy to use object system (derived directly from the .NET),
    * easy access to both functional and imperative features,
    * powerful code-generating macros,
    * variants,
    * pattern matching,
    * static and on-demand dynamic typing,
    * type inference.

Nemerle compiler (written in Nemerle itself), produces IL bytecode and
was tested extensively on .NET Framework 1.1 (Windows XP) and mono 0.29
and 0.30 (Debian GNU/Linux, Mandrake Linux, PLD Linux).

This release includes complete source code (under BSD-like license),
and is mainly meant to be preview for people wanting to experiment with
the language.
