\subsection{Abstract}

The objective of this project is to design and implement a new 
hybrid (functional, object-oriented and imperative) programming 
language for the .NET platform. Key features of the language 
include: simplicity, a C\#-like syntax, easy to use object 
system (derived directly from the .NET), powerful code-generating 
macros, variants, pattern matching and type inference. We plan 
to make the language a full CLS consumer and producer, which 
fits the .NET as good as C\# does.

We will focus on investigating optimization opportunities 
raising as consequence of tightening the language's type system.
We will also try to investigate which way of implementing features
crucial to a functional language would yield the best performance 
on the SSCLI and the current .NET framework.

\section{Project Description}

\subsection{Background}
Building programming language on the .NET framework base, makes large
variety of libraries for performing everyday programming tasks immediately
available. On the other hand lack of libraries (and in general problems
with implementation) seem to be one of major stoppers for functional
programming languages. Designing language that will provide easy way
to access both its functional features and object oriented .NET world
would be major win.

The problem with ports of existing languages is compatibility with
non-.NET ports that makes access to .NET features harder.

Problem z istniejacymi jezykami jest taki ze istnieja, wiec ciezej je przerabiac.


\subsection{Project Details}

The primary goal of this project is to design and implement the language,
and later make people use it. The language project has already reached
mostly stable shape. Also the compiler is in stage where large class of
usable programs can be written. However the quality of compiler, and
especially documentation leaves much space for improvements.

Therefore the main objective of project submitted here is polishing the
implementation and documentation during next six months and maybe later.
This is detailed in Milestones section below.

[[Discuss any requirements your project makes on
other work/technologies, along with any foreseeable limitations.]] -- generics,
rotor?


\subsection{Academic Relevance}

From the academic perspective, probably the most interesting part of
the language is our macro system. It extends (to some extent)
ideas of Meta-Haskell [FIXME:ref]. 

[[Briefly describe how your proposal extends, complements or varies from
previous work in this area. Discuss any opportunity for collaboration
with groups outside your institution.]]


\subsection{Experience}

Micha{\l} Moskal, the project coordinator has implemented few
toy-languages and three bigger ones. First one was Ksi -- front end for
GCC compiler, with lispy syntax, exposing internal syntax trees used in
GCC, thought as back end for other compilers.  Second one was Gont --
C-like language with parametric polymorphism, type inference, garbage
collection and higher order functions. The bootstraping Gont compiler
emits Ksi or C. The third one -- ET version 2 -- was interpreter for
language described by Zdzis{\l}aw Sp{\l}awski in his PhD dissertation.
It has strong normalization property, typesystem and syntax similar to ML,
semantics given by Lambda-2 translation, and has interesting connections
with Proof Theory.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Intellectual Property}

We're going to publish research papers in the area, however main outcome
is language implementation and documentation. Both will be released
under BSD-style license. See \url{http://nemerle.org/license.html}
for details.
