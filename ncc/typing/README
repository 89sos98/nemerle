Pass 1
~~~~~~
The first typing pass binds symbols, infers types and invokes macros.
It traverses the trees several times in ,,random'' order.

Operators and conversions on primitive types are handled just like
ordinary overloaded operators -- external symbol importer adds bogus
overloads, that are then expanded in the code generation.


Implicit conversion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The implicit conversion is possible in the following places:
  
  * call arguments (and thus also operator arguments)
  * type cast body
  * type enforcement body
  * rhs of assignment
  * function return value

Implicit conversion is not applied to the macro arguments, though a
special function is exposed to perform this inside macros.

It would be desirable to have implicit conversion when joining branches
of computations (match, try-catch), but we don have it (yet?).

There are also no implicit conversions during variable initialization.
That is mutable x = 0; will always define x to be of the type int.


Pass 2
~~~~~~
The second typing pass is responsible for:

  * marking values for closure conversion
  * tail call detection
  * transforming property getter calls to property setters, on the lhs 
    of the assignment operator.
  * unused value warning
  * ignored computation warning
  * warning when the implicit conversion makes the call non-tail
  * folding Delayed and ImplicitConversion nodes out
  
It is not extensible, just a plain tree traversal.


Short term TODO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* if (!throw_on_error) discard sources
* if (statestack.IsEmpty && error) throw
* check for x.Provide(x)
* check for x.Provide(y), when there is an edge already
