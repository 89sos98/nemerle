\section{Overview}

\subsection{Project Title}

\subsection{Abstract}

The objective of this project is to design and implement a new 
hybrid (functional, object-oriented and imperative) programming 
language for the .NET platform. Key features of the language 
include: simplicity, a C\#-like syntax, easy to use object 
system (derived directly from the .NET), powerful code-generating 
macros, variants, pattern matching and type inference. We plan 
to make the language a full CLS consumer and producer, which 
fits the .NET as good as C\# does.

We will focus on investigating optimization opportunities 
raising as consequence of tightening the language's type system.
We will also try to investigate which way of implementing features
crucial to a functional language would yield the best performance 
on the SSCLI and the current .NET framework.

\section{Project Description}

\subsection{Background}
Building programming language on the .NET framework base, makes large
variety of libraries for performing everyday programming tasks immediately
available. On the other hand lack of libraries (and in general problems
with implementation) seem to be one of the major stoppers for functional
programming languages. Designing language that will provide easy way
to access both its functional features and object oriented .NET world
would be the major win.

The problem with ports of existing languages is retaining backward
compatibility -- it makes accessing .NET features harder.


\subsection{Project Details}

The primary goal of this project is to design and implement the language,
and later make people use it. The language project has already reached
mostly stable shape. Also the compiler is in stage where large class of
usable programs can be written. However the quality of compiler, and
especially documentation leaves much space for improvements.

Therefore the main objective of project submitted here is polishing the
implementation and documentation during next six months and maybe later.
This is detailed in Milestones section below.

The compiler currently uses boxing techniques to achieve parametric
polymorphism.  However the typesystem is largely modeled after .NET
Generics design \cite{generics}. We plan to start working on generic code
generator soon. As the desktop version of The Framework with generics
is not yet available, we are going to use Rotor with Gyro patches.


\subsection{Academic Relevance}

From the academic perspective, probably the most interesting part of
the language is our macro system. It extends to some extent
ideas of Meta-Haskell \cite{MetaHaskell}, incorporating them into
imperative and object-orinted .NET environment. Our meta-system fits
very well into paradigm of Aspects-Oriented Programming.

\subsection{Experience}

Micha{\l} Moskal, the project coordinator has implemented few
toy-languages and three bigger ones. First one was Ksi -- front end for
GCC compiler, with lispy syntax, exposing internal syntax trees used in
GCC, thought as back end for other compilers.  Second one was Gont --
C-like language with parametric polymorphism, type inference, garbage
collection and higher order functions. The bootstraping Gont compiler
emits Ksi or C. The third one -- ET version 2 -- was interpreter for
language described by Zdzis{\l}aw Sp{\l}awski in his PhD dissertation.
It has strong normalization property, typesystem and syntax similar to ML,
semantics given by Lambda-2 translation, and has interesting connections
with Proof Theory.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Intellectual Property}

We're going to publish research papers in the area, especially concerning
language's meta-system. However, main outcome of the project
is language implementation and documentation. Both will be released
under BSD-style license. See \url{http://nemerle.org/license.html}
for details.
