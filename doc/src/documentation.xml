    That is the language dragons speak, and the language Segoy spoke
    who made the islands of the world, and the language of our lays and
    songs, spells, enchantments, and invocations.

        of standard library, compiler library and macros can be helpful when
        writing programs in functional style and for using full power of Nemerle language
        (it is the preliminary version of our automatically generated docs).

        Until we configure the NDoc tool correctly, probably the better
        reference can be find directly in <a

        <li>Nemerle syntax definition has been added to MIME types, so you
            should be able to have syntax highlighting in all editors supporting
            it (gedit, kview, etc.)</li>
        <li>There is an effort to write a plugin for Visual Studio 2005 (using
            VSIP package), but currently there is too little documentation for
            VSIP and its licence forbids us to open source the plugin. We hope this will
            change after upcoming Beta2 and final release of VS2005.
