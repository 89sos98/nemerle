  <title>Nemerle semantic and syntax extensions</title>

    <title>Intro</title>    
    <body>
      <p>
        You can think about semantic and syntax extensions as system
	of compile-time transforms of code and its automatic
	generation with regard to simple rules. It can be used either
	to automate simple actions performed on similar sets of datatypes
	and fragmets of code or to enrich language with some shortcuts
	to complicated function calls or other programming tricks,
	which makes coding faster.
      </p>
      <p>
        Idea of making simple inline operations on code comes from macros,
	which many languages (especially C, C++) contained since early times
	of compiler design. We are following it in direction of much more
	powerful and at the same time more secure (typesafe) solutions
	like in Haskell template metaprogramming.

    <title>Key features</title>
      <body>
        <ul>
	  <li> creating functions, whose amount and type of arguments depend
	    on each other (like C printf); our system would allow various 
	    transforms resulting in encapsulation of complex function
	    calls into simple and clear code</li>
	</ul>

    <title>Commenting Convention</title>
      <body>
        <p>
	  We are planning to design a convention for commenting code.
	  It should be possible to generate documentation directly from
	  code comments and to access specific parts of code inside the
	  comments. We will try to incorporate ideas from javadoc, monodoc
	  and ocamldoc to make code documenting efficient.

    <title>Standard Library</title>
      <body>
        <p>
	  Adjacent to libraries designed for .NET we will build a library of
	  functions direct in Nemerle. This library will be well commented and
	  described. Using our commenting convention should be enough to allow
	  users to search through the library for specific algorithm, data
	  structures, methods and types. The library will also contain
	  assertions about implemented function, later possibly with proofs and
	  well described examples. We will encourage users to add their code
	  to the library but the code will be inspected and tested before.

    <title>Logic Tools for Nemerle</title>
      <body>
        <p>
	  We are planning to design a set of tools to facilitate the analysis
	  of programs written in Nemerle. We want to include formal
	  reasoning tools and statistical anaysis and profiling programs.
	  We will also make semi automated testing tool based on similar
	  random testing tools written for Haskell.
