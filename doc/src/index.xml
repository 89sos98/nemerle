      <p>
	<b>Nemerle</b> is a new hybrid (functional, object-oriented
	and imperative) programming language for the .NET platform.
      </p>
      <p>
	Key features of the language include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>simplicity,</li>
        <li>C#-like syntax,</li>
        <li>easy to use object system (derived directly from the .NET),</li>
        <li>easy access to both functional and imperative features,</li>
        <li>powerful code-generating macros,</li>
        <li>variants,</li>
        <li>pattern matching,</li>
        <li>static and on-demand dynamic typing,</li>
        <li>type inference.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We plan to make language full CLS consumer and producer soon.

          <b>Jan 26 2004</b><br/>
          We're heading for the 0.1 release around Feb 15. IL code
          generator is now fully operational, we also can export and
          import Nemerle types in DLLs. Macros has undergone much
          redesign.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Jan 4 2004</b><br/>
          Pawel Olszta works on IL code generation using
          <tt>System.Reflection.Emit</tt> to replace our current approach
          with C# compiler in the middle.  He was also working on Nemerle
          type export/import using extended attributes.  Michal Moskal
          has implemented tail recursion elimination, some limited type
          inference and rewritten parser in Nemerle.  Kamil Skalski has
          been working on macros -- several macros are fully functional
          now (<tt>printf</tt>, <tt>for</tt>, <tt>using</tt>).  He also
          rewrite lexer in Nemerle. Compiler contains no C# sources
          any more. Dawid Duda has written few standard library modules.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Nov 26 2003</b><br/>
          Cleanups in documentation. Progress is being made in the
          compiler, particularly in CLS connectivity section (Pawel Olszta)
          and macros (Kamil Skalski).

          Jacek has updated <link>hacking.html</link> file to list
          build requirements. He also updated our build system by adding
          custom configure script.

          They require <tt>mono</tt> package version 0.29 or later,

        </p>
        <p>
          If you have mono installed outside <file>/usr</file>,
          you cannot use these rpms. Use source code release then.

          It contains compiler sources, prebuilt bootstrap compiler
          as a architecture independent .NET binary, and prebuilt
          documentation in HTML version. It can be therefore used for
          both recompilation and binary installation.

        <p>
          There is also mailing list <tt>bugs/at/nemerle.org</tt>,
          but only bug tracker system can post to it.
