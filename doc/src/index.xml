      <p>
	<b>Nemerle</b> is a new hybrid (functional, object-oriented
	and imperative) programming language for the .NET platform.
      </p>
      <p>
	Key features of the language include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>simplicity,</li>
        <li>C#-like syntax,</li>
        <li>easy to use object system (derived directly from the .NET),</li>
        <li>easy access to both functional and imperative features,</li>
        <li>powerful code-generating macros,</li>
        <li>variants,</li>
        <li>pattern matching,</li>
        <li>static and on-demand dynamic typing,</li>
        <li>type inference.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We plan to make language full CLS consumer and producer soon.

          The Subversion activity statistics has been made <a
          ref="http://cia.navi.cx/stats/project/Nemerle">available</a>
          thanks to <a ref="http://cia.navi.cx/">CIA</a>. There are also
          some other statistic available there.

          We're heading for the 0.1 release around Feb 15. IL code
          generator is now fully operational, we also can export and
          import Nemerle types in DLLs. Macros has undergone much
          redesign.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Jan 4 2004</b><br/>
          Pawel Olszta works on IL code generation using
          <tt>System.Reflection.Emit</tt> to replace our current approach
          with C# compiler in the middle.  He was also working on Nemerle
          type export/import using extended attributes.  Michal Moskal
          has implemented tail recursion elimination, some limited type
          inference and rewritten parser in Nemerle.  Kamil Skalski has
          been working on macros -- several macros are fully functional
          now (<tt>printf</tt>, <tt>for</tt>, <tt>using</tt>).  He also
          rewrite lexer in Nemerle. Compiler contains no C# sources
          any more. Dawid Duda has written few standard library modules.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Nov 26 2003</b><br/>
          Cleanups in documentation. Progress is being made in the
          compiler, particularly in CLS connectivity section (Pawel Olszta)
          and macros (Kamil Skalski).

          build requirements. He also updated our build system by adding
          custom configure script.
