      <p>
	<b>Nemerle</b> is a new programming language with the following
        planned features:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>Language with strong polymorphic typing compiled to CIL (.NET),
	    similar to OCaml</li>
	<li>Type inheritance and dynamic types introduced on demand which makes
            programming less error prone but still as easy as in scripting
	    languages</li>
	<li>Efficient integration of functional constructs with imperative
	    and object oriented code together with high level optimizations
	    that makes it possible to create efficient code with high level
	    language</li>
	<li>Easy to write syntax extensions that make programming easier
	    and facilitate the work on large projects</li>
	<li>Translation to and from TRS that gives support for integration
	    with automatic testing, program verification and profiling 
	    tools</li>
	<li>Compatibility with <b>CLI</b> (Common Language Infrastructure, part
	    of Microsoft's <b>.NET</b> framework) that gives access to a large
	    set of libraries, code written in other languages and it works on
	    different software platforms</li>

          Compiler has been partially rewritten, it is now about 4 times
          faster (taking about 6 seconds to compile itself on my box,
          that is 190k of code). Some documentation about compiler internals
          has been made <a ref="ncc.html">available</a>.

        We have already bootstraped Nemerle compiler codenamed
        <tt>ncc</tt>. It's rather limited but capable of compiling
        itself. Therefore <a ref="http://www.ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>
        is no longer needed to compile <tt>ncc</tt>. You just need
        <tt>.NET</tt> runtime environment. OCaml is still needed
        for <a ref="http://www.kernel.pl/~malekith/xspp/">xspp</a>,
        that is needed for building documentation, though. However all
        generated documentation is available from this site.

          more information about available mailing list see

          archives and subscription form there. The mailing list archives

      <body>
        <p>
          The preferred way of reporting bugs is using our bug tracker.
          You can find it at <link>http://nemerle.org/bugs/</link>.
          If you have any problems using the web interface feel free to 
          mail us at <tt>feedback/at/nemerle.org</tt>.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is also mailing list <tt>bugs/at/nemerle.org</tt>,
          but only bug tracker system can post to it.
