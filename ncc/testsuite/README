Test cases format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are four kinds of magical comments:

1. // E: unbound value
2. // W: pattern.*exhaustiv
3. // OK
4. (*
BEGIN-OUTPUT
output
blah
END-OUTPUT
*)
5. (*
BEGIN-INPUT
input
blah
END-INPUT
*)
6. // NO-TEST

First one marks line, we expect error in. "error" is regular expression 
that is matched against actual error in this line.

Second one is the same, but we expect a warning.

Third means that we do not expect any errors in this very line.

Fourth one states two things:
  - we should run this test case
  - we should expect given output (verbatim)

Fifth means that we want these input to be passed to the program during runtime 

Sixth one means that we don't want this file to be tested

Test case that have no "// E:" markers is expected to be compiled 
successfully by both ncc and C# compiler. If it contains no BEGIN-OUTPUT
marker, then it is compiled as C# module (needs no entry point aha 
Main() function).

test.n tries to run all *.n programs in current directory
