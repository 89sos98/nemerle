        <b>Michał Moskal</b> is a project leader, responsible
        for bad decisions concerning language design
        as well as for this ugly code in the compiler. He is
        also the one to complain about RPMs and MSI packages. <a
        ref="http://www.kernel.pl/~malekith/">Home page</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Paweł W. Olszta</b> is responsible for code generation and
        matching optimizations in the compiler.

      <p>
        <b>Ewa Dacko</b> is the project Technical Writer, responsible

        correctness of our research papers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Dawid Duda</b> wrote our standard library as well as the first
        MSI install script.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Łukasz Kaiser</b> is in the project since the very beginning.
        He contributed very useful ideas about the language, particularly 
        about macros.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Marcin 'Qrczak' Kowalczyk</b> contributed several interesting
        ideas about hygienic macros.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Aleksander Mądry</b> wrote the test suite driver program, as well
        as red-black trees in the standard library.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Jacek Śliwerski</b> created our build system and is responsible
        for DEB packages.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Krystian Walec</b> wrote a bit of documentation (in the
        Reference Manual).
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Andrzej Wasylkowski</b> is responsible for the documentation
        (generated from sources) system, and he <b>will</b> write it.
