0.1.2, Apr ?? 2004
  This release brings several important bugfixes, more documentation and
  improvements in macro subsystem.

    * Macros are now hygienic -- that is each macro invocation introduces
      new virtual namespace for generated names. See meta-programming paper
      for details.
    * Macros themselves now sits in namespaces. Notable example is printf,
      that is now Nemerle.IO.printf. You will need to update your sources.
      Common macros (like if and while) are in Nemerle.Core, so no changes
      are needed.
    * The <-> operator now properly computes each expression just once.
    * Loading assembly with -r flag now loads also all assemblies
      referenced by it.
    * New integer operators %|, %& and %^ for common bitwise functions.
      New -- and ++ prefix operators for decrement/increment (both return
      void).
    * Events can be now accessed with add_EventName and remove_EventName,
      no +=/-= syntax yet.
    * Full support for various integer and floating point types (like uint,
      long, double etc). Literals like 0u, 0l, 3.14f are now also supported.
    * SWF examples can now be compiled.
    * "foo" "bar" is now single string literal.
    * Added preliminary SQL helper macros.
    * Reordered parameters of Fold and Map in Hashtable to match List.
    * Few fixes in error messages.
    * Several other bugfixes (particularly with code generation and boxing).

0.1.1, Feb 24 2004
  This is mainly bugfix release.
  
    * Fix bugs with tail call elimination (that lead to stack overflows 
      with simple loops).
    * Introduce new optimization of tail-loops, that doesn't require any
      allocations now.
    * Add -o alias for -out command line option, so ncc behaves in more
      standard way.
    * Fix type cast in foreach macro, it should now work.
