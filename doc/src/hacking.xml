  <title>Random notes for Nemerle developers</title>
  <section id="svn">
    <title>The Subversion</title>
    <body>
      <p>
        You can fetch nemerle tree using following command:
      </p>
<code>
svn co http://nemerle.org/svn/nemerle/trunk nemerle
</code>
      <p>
        This will create <tt>nemerle/</tt> directory (last parameter)
        below current working directory.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should use entire sentences when writing commit logs. Sentence
        starts with capital letter and ends with a dot. Keep this in mind,
        as ChangeLog files in releases are automatically generated from
        commit logs, and should look consistent. Don't use past forms in
        commit logs. For example write "Add foobar to function baz." not
        "Added foobar to function baz."  (this is common practice).

    <title>Tools</title>
    <body>
      <p>
        There are some tools, you will probably find useful while
        helping us write all the software, and documentation related
        to the project.  We try to keep this list complete, and up to
        date, but there still may be some pieces of software, that we
        forgot, as it seems natural for us to have it installed.

      <title>Essential to build Nemerle Compiler</title>
      <body>
        <p>
	  You need a .NET environment, and a C# compiler.  There are
	  several environments you can find.
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><a ref="http://www.microsoft.com/net">MS .NET</a></li>
	  <li><a ref="http://go-mono.com">Mono</a></li>
	  <li><a ref="http://www.dotgnu.org">DotGNU</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	  These development frameworks provide you with a C# compiler
	  which is required to build any program written with nemerle
	  (including nemerle compiler itself).
	</p>
	<p>
	  To regenerate parser, you need jay (which is distributed
	  with mono), and perl.

      <title>Other tools</title>
      <body>
        <p>
	  These are not prerequisites to do any task, but may be very
	  helpful, and we ask you to use them, as they minimize amount
	  of mistakes.
        </p>
	<ul>
	  <li>We suggest to scan documents with
<code>
ispell -d american -h file.xml
</code>
              or use your favorite development environment to do it
	      for you.</li>
	  <li>To validate XML syntax use
<code>
xmllint --noout --xinclude file.xml
</code>
              </li>
