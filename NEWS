0.1.1, Feb XX 2004
  This is mainly bugfix release.
  
    * Fix bugs with tail call elimination (that lead to stack overflows 
      with simple loops).
    * Introduce new optimization of tail-loops, that doesn't require any
      allocations now.
    * Add -o alias for -out command line option, so ncc behaves in more
      standard way.
