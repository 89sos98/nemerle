    <title>What Nemerle is?</title>
    <body>
      <p>
        <b>Nemerle</b> is a high-level statically-typed programming language
        for the .NET platform. It offers functional, object-oriented
        and imperative features. It has a simple C#-like syntax
        and a powerful meta-programming system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Features that come from the functional land are variants,
        pattern matching and type inference and parameter polymorphism (aka generics). 
        Meta-system allows great compiler extensibility, embedding domain specific languages,
        partial evaluation and aspect-oriented programming. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Beginning with the 0.2.0 release, language is a full CLS consumer
        and producer.
      </p>

      <title>What Nemerle is <b>not</b>?</title>
      <body>
        <p>
          Nemerle is not a dynamically typed language in the spirit
          of Python or Perl. One does not write the types only when the
          compiler knows them anyway (which is most of the time).
        </p>
        <p>
          Nemerle meta-programming system (macros) have nothing in common
          with macros in C. They are more akin to the Lisp macros.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nemerle is not far away from C#. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Semantically Nemerle is mostly a C# superset.
        </p>
        <p>
          Syntactically they are very close, the differences here
          are well thought out and necessary to make the language
          consistent. All the people who consider Nemerle syntax odd,
          compared to the C# one, are referred to the Haskell and/or
          Lisp manuals.
