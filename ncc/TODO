Sorted wrt priority:

+ prune iface methods from parent interfaces when collecting class members (tyinfo.n)
+ checking for correct implementation of all methods (tyexpr.n)
+ better error messages for named parameters (tyexpr.n)

+ Other FIXME stuff.


Objectives, in planned order:

1. Bootstrap. It's not appealing to fix two compilers in parallel.
2. Direct CLS connectivity (writing prototypes also ain't nice).
3. Better end-user support (error messages, fixing crashes on invalid 
   input). This will be achieved over the time, but it isn't very
   important up to this point.
4. Generic IL bytecode generation.
5. Support arrays, ref/out parameters, structs, enums and other beasts.
